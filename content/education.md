Elder Financial Fraud is unfortunately a booming business.  It is estimated that approximately $1.7 BILLION dollars was lost to financial scams involving older adults in 2021 alone.  The criminals are getting smarter.  The scams are getting more complex.  We fight this by educating senior citizens on how to look out for the red flags of scams.  We teach best practices for crime prevention.
